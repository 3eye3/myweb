<p><font color="red">Enemy is better then a Fake friend</font></p><br>
<p>This is a psychological advice.</p>
<p><font size="10px">Here is some lines for you</font></p>
<p><i>The reason behind this.</i></p>
<p>NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRINDSHIP</p>
<P><sup>Be wary of friends--they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend,because he has more to prove, In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies,find a way to make them.</sup></p>
